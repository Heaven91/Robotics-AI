# Robotics-AI
This repository is about some basic Python codes implemented according to Sesbian's class. Different form resources provided by the class, here I put some different codes wrote by my own, but most of them are same. Secondly, I will put the notes for each important code lines. At last , I plan to write a blog about the calss, to explain main ideas in each chapter.
